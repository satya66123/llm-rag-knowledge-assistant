RAG, Embeddings, and FAISS Notes

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
It combines:
1) Retrieval (searching relevant documents)
2) Generation (LLM produces final answer)

Instead of relying only on an LLM’s internal memory, RAG fetches relevant context and feeds it
into the prompt.
This improves accuracy and reduces hallucination.

Core RAG Flow:
1) Load documents
2) Chunk documents into small parts
3) Convert each chunk into an embedding
4) Store embeddings in a vector database or index
5) For a query:
   - Convert query into embedding
   - Find nearest chunks using similarity search
   - Provide top chunks as context to the LLM

Embeddings:
Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
Similar meanings produce vectors close to each other.

FAISS:
FAISS is a vector similarity search library developed by Facebook AI Research.
It efficiently finds nearest vectors for semantic search.
FAISS supports multiple index types. IndexFlatL2 is a simple and reliable baseline index.

Important chunking concepts:
- Chunk size
- Chunk overlap
Chunk overlap helps avoid losing context at chunk boundaries.
