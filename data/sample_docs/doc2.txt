Python and FastAPI Notes

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
It is based on standard Python type hints and supports asynchronous programming.

Why FastAPI is popular:
1) High performance:
FastAPI is built on Starlette and Pydantic, making it one of the fastest Python frameworks.

2) Type-safe development:
Using Python type hints enables automatic validation, serialization, and documentation.

3) Automatic Docs:
FastAPI generates Swagger UI and ReDoc automatically.
- Swagger UI: /docs
- ReDoc: /redoc

Example FastAPI endpoint:
- @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
- async def read_item(item_id: int)

Key concepts:
- Path parameters
- Query parameters
- Request body using Pydantic models
- Response models
- Dependency Injection using Depends()

FastAPI works well with microservices, backend systems, and AI model serving.
It can also integrate with authentication (JWT), databases, and external APIs.
